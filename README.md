# mnist-nn
# Goal:
Using PyTorch to train a NN with the MNIST dataset with atleast 90% accuracy

# Result:

A simple CNN that trains on the MNIST dataset and saves the trained model for reuse

- Automatically trains a CNN if no saved model is found.
- Saves the model as 'model.h5'.
- Automatically loads the model on future runs.
- Displays sample predictions.

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
